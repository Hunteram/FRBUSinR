========================================================
Study of FRB/US model packages from the Federal Reserve (and perhaps port to R language)
--------------------------------------------------------
[FRB/US model packages](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/frbus/us-models-package.htm):

"The main FRB/US model package is a self-contained set of equations, data, programs and documentation that enables various types of simulations and provides information about the model's structure."

"NOTE: The programs for simulating the FRB/US model are written for use with the software EViews, available at [www.EViews.com](http://www.EViews.com)"

Github: [proudindiv/FRBUSinR](https://github.com/proudindiv/FRBUSinR):

Unfortunately, EViews is propritary software and hence not readily accessible.  My thought is to explore the information provided by the Federal Reserve using the open source R-language and other freely available tools for truly reproducable results.

My project is at [proudindiv/FRBUSinR](https://github.com/proudindiv/FRBUSinR) on [github](https://github.com).  I hope to produce something that attracts others to participate.
